### About the Experiment 

This experiment is based on the Archimedes principle. Archimedes’ principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid dynamics. 
“It states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether wholly or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces and acts in the upward direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid.”
If the weight of the fluid displaced is less than the weight of the object, the object will sink. The object will float if the weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the weight of the object. This upward force is known as thrust or buoyant force. It is a consequence of the difference in pressure the fluid exerts at different heights. The fluid pressure is exerted in all directions (Pascal’s principle) and increases with depth. There is an unbalanced upward force on the bottom of a submerged object.
